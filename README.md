# IrisMark-Assignment 2021
 Final assignment of Modern Web Platforms course

More you can read in the _READ ME folder: assignment

So this is the assignment. Much is not clear to me... The course is online without any guidance. Especially the JS part was done poorly in my opinion. Just snippets of code, with no actually example how to use them. I mean we do arrays and loops etc, but no example what you can use them for or how to show them on your page in correct style.

Also I still don't get forms. Where is the form going to? How as an administrator do I get the info from the user input?

I made this assignment as a cv/portfolio. In green my comments. You can leave your comments in red if you would like. Thanks, Iris
